# MoanGem Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the MoanGem gaming platform to Vercel.

## Frontend-Only Deployment to Vercel

The 404 error you were experiencing has been fixed! Here's what was causing it and how it's now resolved:

### The Problem
- React Router handles client-side routing
- When users visit URLs like `/games` or `/about`, Vercel looks for static files
- Since these routes don't exist as files, Vercel returned 404 errors

### The Solution
We've added proper configuration files:

1. **`vercel.json`** - Configures Vercel to:
   - Route all requests to `index.html` so React Router can handle them
   - Set up proper caching for static assets
   - Add security headers

2. **`.vercelignore`** - Excludes backend and unnecessary files from deployment

3. **`.env.production`** - Production environment configuration

4. **Improved API handling** - Better fallbacks when backend is unavailable

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it as a React app

2. **Configuration:**
   - Root Directory: Leave as `.` (the vercel.json handles the frontend directory)
   - Build Command: Will use the one from `vercel.json`
   - Output Directory: Will use `frontend/build` as specified

3. **Environment Variables (Optional):**
   - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: Set this if you have a separate backend deployment
   - If not set, the app will work in demo mode with mock data

### Features in Demo Mode
When the backend is unavailable (frontend-only deployment):
- ‚úÖ All UI components work perfectly
- ‚úÖ Games are playable with local scoring
- ‚úÖ Mock leaderboards and challenges display
- ‚úÖ All navigation and routing works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scores won't persist (no backend)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User authentication disabled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real crypto rewards unavailable

### Full-Stack Deployment
For a complete deployment with backend functionality:
1. Deploy the backend to a platform like Railway, Render, or Vercel Functions
2. Update `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel environment variables
3. Ensure backend has proper CORS configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting 404 errors?
1. Check that `vercel.json` is in the root directory
2. Verify the build is successful in Vercel dashboard
3. Ensure the output directory contains `index.html`

### App loads but shows errors?
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check that API fallbacks are working (should show mock data)

The app is now configured to work perfectly on Vercel with proper routing! üöÄ
